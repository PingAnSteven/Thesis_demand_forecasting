# Thesis_demand_forecasting

Most of the restaurants are facing an uncertain demand which can seem impossible to predict. 
In addition, at the opposite of manufacturers, restaurants are part of the service industry leading to the inability to “stock”. 
Therefore, it is critical for restaurants to predict the number of clients per shift or at least to have a range of it.
Restaurants are dealing with two type of decisions when it comes to prepare a shift:
• How many workers do I need?
• How much stock should I prepare?

These issues can be solved by a predictive model giving an idea of the number of customers who will come per shift or per week. 
Therefore, it will result in a better stock and human resource management leading to substantial cost reduction.

The methodology used will be the CRISP-DM methodology, developed at the end of the 90’s and still widely used. 
It consists of six steps: Business understanding, Data understanding, Data preparation, Modelling, Evaluation and Deployment. 
The goal of this thesis is not only developing a theorical model but also to test and implement it in a real business environment.

In this work, we will explore several models, optimizers, etc.
